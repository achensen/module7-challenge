## Additional Notes 
I did recieve tutoring assistance to help with my understanding of this assignment. I was having an issue in VS code 
where writeFile was not overwriting my previous ReadMe that I generated. My tutor helped me trouble shoot this issue 
by showing me how to redownload my window in VS code, I also verbally walked through all the code to make sure my conceptual
understanding was accuarate, and I got clarification on ternary operators like the one used in lines 74/75 of my index.js.
